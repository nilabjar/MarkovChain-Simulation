
Deadline missed is related to the edge that represents the transition. Its probabilty is calculated by the originating state and the rate. 

Thus deadline missed info is best associated with the edge. It can be calculated by parsing through the states and parsing the outgoing arcs.

****COMPUTATIONAL DISCREPENCY ************

**** What i see is a lot of computational discrepency   ... The same set of equations solved thru matlab gives different answers when run differently....
